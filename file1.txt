cd /path/to/your/project
git init
3. Add the Remote Repository (in bash)
You’ll see a URL on GitHub after creating the repo. It will look as below , run  this command in git bash:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-private-repo.git
4. Add and Commit Your Files(in bash)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
5. Push to the Private Repository 
If the repo is new and empty, push like this from git bash:

Task 3 Collaborative coding using git
1. Collaborative coding.
a. Facilitating Collaborative Work by creating Organization
Step 1:  Click on New organization in Git hub
         Click on Create a free organization.
Step 2:  Set up your organization by entering the details like name, associated email, account verification, etc.
         Click on Next
Step 3:  Complete the setup by 
	adding members to the group.
	Now, the invitation goes to other collaborator and they must accept.
	Next click on complete setup
	Goto Github and click on 
Settings  Member privileges  Base permissions  Select write  change base permission to “Write”  
Next under,
   Projects base permissions  Select Write  change base permission to “Write”  
Step 4:  Create the remote repository for storing the project related files in Organization. 
 
b. To collaborate effectively on GitHub shared repository by sharing code and coordinating with others through a shared repository.
Steps for Collaborator 1 are:(collaborator-1 has repository that he wants to share with collaborator-2)
	Go to Settings > collaborators
	Now in Manage Access click on Add people
	Now you will be able to see ONE collaborator added
	After this invitation goes to collaborator 2 and they need to accept it.

Steps for Collaborator 2 are:
1. Set Up Git and GitHub
In git bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com
$ git remote –v // Note now, not connected to any remote
2. Go to Git hub and copy url of shared repository by collaborator 1	
• Copy url (option 1)
3. Clone the Repository
Get a local copy of the repo:
	In git bash
	git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
	cd repository-name
4. Create a Branch for Your Work
Always work on a separate branch:
In git bash
	git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
5. Make Changes and Commit
Edit files, then stage and commit your changes:
In git bash to existing file / new file  
	git add .	
	git commit -m "Add a clear and descriptive commit message"
6. Push Your Branch to GitHub
	In git bash
	git push origin feature/your-feature-name
7.  Keep Your Branch Updated (has to be done by owner collaborator 1)
Before making new changes:
In git bash
	git checkout main
	git pull origin main
	git checkout feature/your-new-feature
	git merge main


Exercise on Fork
Following steps needed if you forked from any public repository to contribute to Person 1
1. Go to: `https://github.com/Person1/awesome-project` (of Person 1)
2. Click the “Fork” button at the top-right of the page.
3. GitHub will create a copy of that repository in your account (say Person2):
       https://github.com/your-username/awesome-project
as
         https://github.com/Person2/awesome-project
4. Clone your forked repo: in bash (by Person 2) 
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/awesome-project
	Make changes.
	git add .
	 git Commit 
	git push origin main
5. Create or  a “pull request” back to the original repo (`othername/awesome-project) to suggest your changes. (by Person 2)
 Click at top “Pull request” or click on  at top or click on repo “awesome-project” then click on Contribute at top then click on “open pull request”
 Add title and Add a description if you want. Below it shows what changes you made to file  
 Click on Create pull request
Now you see on page message “NO conflicts with base branch”
6.  By Person 1
•	Pull requests 1  appears at top in git hub account of Person 1 
•	Clicking on “Pull requests” shows: 
   Commit by Person 2. Click on this commit message.
   It redirect to repository (say awesome-project)
•	Click on “File changed 1” to see changes made by Person 2
•	Click on “Review Changes”, add review and  click on “submit review”
•	Click on Merge pull request
•	Confirm merge
Note:  It displays “Pull request Successfully merged and closed” to Person 1
•	Now go to Code and see changes have been merged to the file. 
•	In commit it shows: Commit by Person 2
                                 Merge commit by Person 1
7.  Merge the Pull Request (has to be done by both collaborators)
Once approved:
•	The repo owner can click Merge pull request
8.  Keep Your Branch Updated (has to be done by Person 1 and Person 2)
Before making new changes:
In git bash
	git checkout main
	git pull origin main
	git checkout feature/your-new-feature
	git merge main
	cd repository-name


2. To resolve conflicts when collaborating on same part of code.
Steps to Resolve a Conflict
1. See Which Files Are in Conflict (Say f1.txt)
In git bash
	git status
   Conflicted files will be marked like:
In git bash
	both modified:  (Say f1.txt)
3.	Open the File and Look for Conflict Markers by clicking on
 Click on Resolve Conflict
Git will insert conflict markers in the file like this:
def greet():
<<<<<<< HEAD
    print("Hello from First collaborator ")
=======
    print("Hello from second collaborator ")
>>>>>>> feature/second collaborator branch
This shows the two conflicting changes:
•	HEAD is your version
•	The section below ======= is the other branch’s version or second collaborator branch version
3. Edit the File to Fix the Conflict
	Choose one version or combine them:
	def greet():
   	     print("Hello from First collaborator ")
                    print("Hello from second collaborator ")
	Then delete all the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
4. Mark the Conflict as Resolved
Once you've edited and saved the file:
	git add f1.txt
5. Complete the Merge or Pull
	git commit    # Only needed if you're merging
Or if you're rebasing:
	git rebase --continue
⚠️ If You Want to Abort the Merge
If it gets messy and you want to cancel:
git merge --abort
Example :
Merge Conflict – Changes made to a file by two different users leads to merge conflict as below.
Say I am collaborator 2, now
 Accept invitation from collaborator 1
 Next goes to Shared repository by collaborator 1 (say abcrepo)
 Now open Git bash and clone the shared repo as below steps
Step 1: first connect to this “abcrepo” to local repository by clone
 Now change directory to “abcrepo”
 Switch to branch feature-abc
 Now add line in README.md file
 Now git add, commit
 Now see status and push to remote branch feature-abc
 Now go to Github and refresh or click on “abcrepo”, you can see  README.md
Step 2: Now collaborator 2 adding line in README.md, save, git add, commit,  push. No conflicts
Step 3: Also collaborator 1 adding line in README.md at same line collaborator 2 added, then git add, commit, push gives merge conflict. 
NOTE IMPORTANT :
Now collaborator 2 has to give git pull command then open conflicting file to see conflict markers.
Now Edit the File to Fix the Conflict by keeping either or both collaborator changes and remove conflict markers. Add file, commit, and push. 



3. To create and apply patch 
A patch in Git is a text file that represents changes between two sets of files, or commits. 
Steps:
1.	Goto github and take public project url
2.	Clone into git bash
3.	Now open file and edit it, add, commit
4.	Run git log 
5.	Create patch with commit hash code as:
git format-patch -1 commit-hash-code
           This creates 0001-commit-from-cloned-person.patch file.
Note: git format-patch -1 <commit-hash>
•	-1 means "create a patch from 1 commit"
•	This creates a .patch file for a single commit.
•	Example: git format-patch -1 abc1234
•	This creates a file like 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
To create patches for the last 3 commits: git format-patch -3 
	or
Create patches from multiple commits
	git format-patch <base_commit>..HEAD
6. Get the path of above patch file and email or what’s up to the remote owner of file.
7. Once the remote owner gets the patch file 0001-commit-from-cloned-person.patch next the owner need to apply patch file in his git bash  using git command below:
	Syntax:
		git apply my-changes.patch
                 	  Or, if it's a patch made by git format-patch, use:
		git am 0001-Your-commit-message.patch  
	git apply 0001-Your-commit-message.patch

Note:-Now push yours Maven java project and Maven Web Project into your GitHub

3. Configure Java Version via Compiler Plugin
In pom.xml:
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.11.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <source>17</source>
    <target>17</target>
  </configuration> </plugin>
Check:
•	Run mvn package
•	Inspect generated JAR: jar tf target/myapp.jar

4. JUnit Testing and Reports
Place test files in src/test/java. Example:
public class AppTest {
    @Test
    public void testSum() {
        assertEquals(5, 2 + 3);
    }
}
Run:
mvn test
Check:
•	target/test-classes/ → compiled test .class files
•	target/surefire-reports/ → .txt or .xml test results
If test fails → corresponding log and failure trace shown 

5. Handling Errors in pom.xml
	Typos in version numbers or missing repositories cause BUILD FAILURE
	Maven shows precise error in console
	Fix the dependency tag → re-run mvn clean install

6. Adding Resource Files
Put config.properties inside:
src/main/resources/config.properties
To read:
InputStream input = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("config.properties");
After build, check target/classes/ → file should exist there.

7. Multi-Module and Parent Projects
Structure:
parent/
 ├── pom.xml (packaging: pom)
 ├── core/
  |     └── pom.xml
 └── web/
       └── pom.xml
	Parent pom.xml defines <modules> and common dependencies
	Each submodule builds independently into its target/ directory

8. Executable JARs
Add to pom.xml:
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <archive>
          <manifest>
            <mainClass>com.example.Main</mainClass>
          </manifest>
        </archive>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
Run:
mvn package
java -jar target/myapp.jar

9.	Building a WAR File
Create a Maven web project with structure:
src/main/webapp/
 └── WEB-INF/web.xml

Add:
<packaging>war</packaging>
Command:
mvn package
Generates target/mywebapp.war → deploy on Tomcat server.


Week 5 Docker CLI commands

Working with Docker CLI Commands:
Docker CLI Commands with redis
Step 1: Pull the redis Image
docker pull redis
Step 2: Run a Redis Container
docker run --name my-redis -d redis
What It Does:
• Creates and starts a container named my-redis from the redis image.
• The -d flag runs the container in the background.
Step 3: Check Running Containers
docker ps
What It Does:
• Lists all running containers.
Step 4: Access Redis
docker exec -it my-redis redis-cli
Opens the Redis command-line tool (redis-cli) inside the container.
Example Redis Commands:
127.0.0.1:6379> SET name "Alice"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET name
"Alice"
127.0.0.1:6379>exit // to come out
Step 5: Stop the Redis Container
docker stop my-redis
What It Does:
• Stops the Redis container but doesn’t delete it.
Step 6: Restart the Redis Container
docker start my-redis
What It Does:
• Restarts the stopped container.
Step 7: Remove the Redis Container
docker rm my-redis  // Note before removing stop the container
What It Does:
• Deletes the container permanently.
Step 8: Remove the Redis Image
docker rmi redis
What It Does:
• Deletes the Redis image from your local system.


2.Working with Docker file
A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to create a custom Docker image.
Step 1: Set Up Your Folder
1. Windows:
o Create a folder like C:\DockerProjects\Redis.
o Open Git Bash and navigate to the folder:
cd /c/DockerProjects/Redis
2. Mac/Linux:
o Create a folder:
mkdir ~/DockerProjects/Redis
cd ~/DockerProjects/Redis
Step 2: Write the Dockerfile
1. Inside the folder, create a file named Dockerfile (no extension).
2. Add the following content:
FROM redis:latest
CMD ["redis-server"]


Docker Commands (Step-by-step):
1. docker build -t redisnew  .
What it does:
• This creates (builds) a Docker image using the recipe (Dockerfile) in the current
folder (.).
• -t redisnew: Gives the image a name/tag ("redisnew"), so you can find it easily.
2. docker run --name myredisnew -d redisnew
What it does:
• Starts a new container (mini computer) from the redisnew image.
• --name myredisnew: Names the container "myredisnew" so it’s easy to identify.
• -d: Runs the container in the background.
3. docker ps

Week 6 Docker compose 
Example Docker Compose File (Simple)
Here’s a basic example of a Docker Compose file that runs WordPress and MySQL together:
version: '3.8'  # Docker Compose file format version

services:
  wordpress:  # WordPress service
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "8081:80"  # Map port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306  # Database host
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
    depends_on:
      - db  # Ensures the db service starts first

  db:  # MySQL service
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

How to Run It
To run a multi-container setup like the one above:
Save the file as docker-compose.yml.
                Or
docker-compose.yaml
2. To Start the compose
docker-compose up –d
3. To stop the containers 
docker-compose down
4.To scale the container
docker-compose up --scale <service name>=2 -d

1.Define and run multiple interdependent services
Task:
I. Create a new folder compose-lab
Inside it, create a file docker-compose.yml with the following content:
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: demo
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: demo
      POSTGRES_DB: demo_db
II. Run the setup:
docker compose up -d
III. Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:8080.
IV. Expected Output:
Nginx welcome page is displayed.
db container runs in the background.

2.Write and interpret docker-compose.yml files
Task:
I. Modify docker-compose.yml to add a Redis cache:
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
II. Add a depends_on so web waits for Redis:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    depends_on:
      - redis
III. Restart the setup:
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
IV. Expected Output:
Three services (web, db, redis) are listed as running.

3.Deploy across different machines
Task:
I. Zip your compose-lab folder.
Transfer it to another machine with Docker Compose installed.
II. Run:
docker compose up -d
Check that Nginx and Postgres work there as well.
III. Expected Output:
The same services run on the new machine without changes.

4.Networking and persistent storage
Task:
I. Update your docker-compose.yml to add a custom network and volume:
networks:
  app-net:

volumes:
  db-data:

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - app-net
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: demo
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: demo
      POSTGRES_DB: demo_db
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-net
II. Run:
docker compose up -d
III. Insert some data into Postgres (optional with psql).
IV. Remove containers:
docker compose down
V. Start again:
docker compose up -d
VI. Expected Output:
Database data persists across restarts.
Services communicate via the app-net network using service names.

5.Faster iteration during development
Task: 
I. Create a simple Flask app in app.py:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from Flask + Docker!"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

II. Add a Dockerfile in the same folder:
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py /app/
RUN pip install flask
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
III. Update docker-compose.yml:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
IV. Run:
docker compose up --build
Visit http://localhost:5000.
Change the return text in app.py (e.g., "Hello Docker Compose!").
V. Rebuild:
docker compose up –build  // No need to rebuild 
Visit http://localhost:5000.
VI. Expected Output:
New message appears instantly after rebuild.



Week 7
Creating a Multi-Module Maven Project:
1.	Open eclipse-> file-> new -> other -> Maven -> MavenProject ->click on next.
2.	Check the first option: Create a Simple project(skip archetype selection) and click on next.
3.	Give groupID: KMIT, artifact ID: MultiModule, in the packaging tab select the drop down and opt for pom.
4.	Give Name: Multimodule creation and Description: Sample multimodule with parent child hierarchy and click on next.
5.	Now the Multimodule folder is created and displayed in the project explorer on the left. Right click on the folder and opt new -> mavenModule
6.	Check the option Create a Simple project(skip archetype selection, give the artifactID: MultiModuleChild1 and click on next and finish.
7.	Now you can see, the module1 we created is displayed in the project explorer with a separate pom.xml file.
8.	Right click on the MultiModule folder in the project explorer and opt new -> mavenModule
9.	Give the artifactID: MultiModuleChild2 and click on next.
10.	In filters search for maven-archetype-webapp, select the version 1.1/1.5 and click on next.
11.	Now click on finish, and confirm with a Y in the console.
12.	Now you can watch the new child is been added to the parent project.
Note: Childs or Modules can be added to the projects who have the packaging type as pom. If we try to create a module within child1 it is not possible since its packaging is opted to JAR.
Linking two modules in a Parent Project:
Go to the module u want to connect. And add a dependency to other module on which the current module depends. For example if my child2 is dependent on child1. I have to change the dependencies in the pom.xml by adding a new dependency of child1.
Steps to add dependency:
1.	Goto pom.xml of child2.
2.	Navigate to dependencies tag. Update the dependencies with child1 dependency as given below, and save pom.xml after update.
<dependency>
		<groupId>KMIT</groupId>
			<artifactId>MultimoduleChild1</artifactId>
			<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
3.	Now build the child2 by right clicking it and opting run as->maven build.
4.	The build will be a failure. Because we haven’t build the parent project and the child project. Child1 is dependent on parent. And Child2 is dependent on child2. SO we have to build ass the previous module first and then build the current child2.
5.	After building parent and child1, build child2 now the build will be a Success
